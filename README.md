Here you can find some of the datasets used in the Final Project for the online course (coursera): Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Representation in Python, from Michigan University.  
HispanicPop_AnnArbor.zip contains seven *xls files that corresponds to the hispanic population in Ann Arbor, MI for the years 2010-2016. Each file for each year.
The seven xls files were originally downloaded from the official website: United States Census Bureau using the AmericanFactFinder tool: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml.

Since the search tool requieres the use of filters to find a specific dataset, and I was not able to get the appropriate link. I have decided to create this repository in order to have in one place all the Ann-Arbor information needed for the Final Project.  The links for the other datasets used in the Project were given at the moment of the Project submission.
