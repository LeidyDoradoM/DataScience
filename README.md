Here you can find some of the datasets used in the Final Project for the online course (coursera): Applied Plotting, Charting and Data Representation in Python, from Michigan University.  
HispanicPop_AnnArbor.zip contains seven *xls files that correspond to the hispanic population in Ann Arbor, MI for the years 2010-2016. Each file for each year.
The seven xls files were originally downloaded from the official website: United States Census Bureau using the AmericanFactFinder tool: https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml.

Since the search tool requieres the use of filters to find a specific dataset, and I was not able to get the appropriate link. I have decided to create this repository in order to have in one place all the Ann-Arbor information needed for the Final Project.  The links for the other datasets used in the Project were provided at the moment of the Project submission and are also attached here:
